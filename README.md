XAX THREADS
Welcome to the XAX THREADS website repository! This project is a static website built with HTML and CSS, designed to introduce users to our brand and showcase our upcoming features.

Project Overview
The XAX THREADS website currently includes:

Home Page: Showcases featured products, promotional offers, and links to our social media.
Coming Soon Page: A placeholder page for all other sections under development, including Products, About, and Contact pages.
In this initial release, only the Home page is fully available, giving users a preview of our brand and products. All other pages are currently marked as "Coming Soon" and will be accessible in future updates.

Coming Soon Page
To keep the design cohesive, the "Coming Soon" page is styled similarly to the Home page. It includes:

A consistent header with the brand logo and navigation links.
A simple, centered message informing users that these sections are under development.
A footer with links, a newsletter signup, and contact information for those who want to stay connected.
This placeholder page is meant to let users know that exciting updates are on the way, so they can anticipate the launch of these additional sections.

Technologies Used
HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling.
Font Awesome for social media icons in the footer.
Google Fonts for typography.
Upcoming Features
We are working to expand the site beyond the Home page. Here’s a preview of the planned features:

Products Page: A fully interactive catalog of our items with images, descriptions, and filtering options.
About Page: Information about XAX THREADS, our brand values, mission, and team.
Contact Page: A form for users to reach out with questions or feedback.
Enhanced Home Page: Additional interactivity, such as product highlights and announcements, to keep users engaged.
Mobile Optimization: Improvements to make the site more responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices.
